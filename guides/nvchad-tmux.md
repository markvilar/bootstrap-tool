The guide includes the following:

### Vim Tmux Navigator

This document covers the setup of Vim Tmux Navigator for Neovim with NvChad. 
Major parts of the setup is covered in the [Vim Tmux Navigator repository](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator), 
but some additional modifications are needed to resolve bugs and errors.

- See `config/nvim` to see the Neovim (NvChad) configuration.
